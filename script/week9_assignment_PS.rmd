#### Write a small paragraph about what you think (or know) your central research question might be for your PhD or Masters. Bold your main question, italisize the name of your study species, and be sure to include a picture of your study species/study site/or another picture. ===========================

**How do land use and climate change interactively impact shellfish aquaculture?**

For my dissertation reserach, I would like to understand how human impacts (warming, runoff, etc.) affect shellfish aquaculture in California and abroad. I would like to start with a lab study where I manipulate temperature levels and runoff to see how they affect mussel (*Mytilus galloprovincialis*) and oyster (*Crassostrea pacifica*) growth and also monitor the oysters and mussels benig grown in the field over multiple years and compare their growth during drought & non-drought conditions. I'm hoping to measure traits that are of interest ecologists, growers, and nutritionists to get a full scope of how these human impacts affect relevant outcomes of shellfish aquaculture.

```{r storms, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

str(storms)

ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = storms) +
    geom_point(aes(x = wind, y = pressure, color = status), pch = 21, alpha = .05) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +

    theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +

```


#### Create a table that identifies the mean wind, pressure, ts_diameter, hu_diameter of each status of storm (remember to remove NAs!). Use the package htmlTable. Round each mean to only two decimal places (Hint look up the function round) ========
```{r}

library(htmlTable)

Storm_table <- storms %>%
  na.omit(ts_diameter, hu_diameter) %>% # COULD ALSO USE drop_na HERE
  group_by(status) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wind = mean(wind), mean_pressure = mean(pressure), mean_ts = mean(ts_diameter), mean_hu = mean(hu_diameter))

Storm_table$mean_wind <- round(Storm_table$mean_wind, digits = 2)
Storm_table$mean_pressure <- round(Storm_table$mean_pressure, digits = 2)
Storm_table$mean_ts <- round(Storm_table$mean_ts, digits = 2)
Storm_table$mean_hu <- round(Storm_table$mean_hu, digits=2)

htmlTable(Storm_table)
```

#### CHALLENGE Find the duration, in number of days, of every hurricane from 2010 and later, and then use one of the map functions from purrr to write a sentence saying “Hurricane X lasted Y days” for each of these storms. You can look for some help with these functions here and here.==================

```{r}

library(lubridate)

storms_2010_2015 <- storms %>%
  filter(year >= 2010) %>% 
  group_by(name, year) %>% 
  summarize(duration = diff(range(day)))

storms_2010_2015

map2_chr(.x = storms_2010_2015$name, .y = storms_2010_2015$duration, function(x,y) paste("Hurricane", x, "lasted", y, "days"))
  

```
